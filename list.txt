They could have asked in a more graceful manner but too late for that. I think the point here is if you are particular about certain items get them yourself and just have shoppers pick up items that you don‚Äôt mind replacements for or certain flavors or brands don‚Äôt matter to you. If you are particular, put in the notes sections of the items ‚Äúrefund only‚Äù or ‚Äúno replacements‚Äù. Or even ask them in the notes to send you photos of available options before replacing. \n\nAnd to the shoppers: stop throwing anything in the cart just so your pay doesn‚Äôt decrease. Do your job with integrity or don‚Äôt do it at all. Trying to stiff people will keep you in a moral and financial deficit. \n\nIf a customers requests a replacement and I send photos and they don‚Äôt respond to what option they want, I let them know if I don‚Äôt hear from them before checkout, I‚Äôm refunding the item . Because I‚Äôm not about to hear from no one I picked out items they didn‚Äôt like. Yea my pay might go down a couple dollar but it‚Äôs already freaking low. What the point of being dishonest/doing a bad job over 2-5 dollars. All you gonna do is make the customers who can take or leave using instant LEAVE Instacart. And when customers are low‚Ä¶where is your money going to come from then? So stop being greedy .\n\n Anyway  so to the customers: there are still good shoppers out there, when you get one l, tip them more at the end  if you can. Word will spread and maybe the lazy/inconsiderate shoppers will tighten up because they want the money more than anything.\n\nThis is my 2 cents.
